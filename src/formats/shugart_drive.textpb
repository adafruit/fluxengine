comment: 'Adjust configuration for a Shugart drive'
is_extension: true

documentation:
<<<
This is an extension profile; adding this to the command line will configure
FluxEngine to adjust the pinout to work with a Shugart drive. This only works
on Greaseweazle hardware.

For example:

```
fluxengine read ibm --720 shugart_drive
```
>>>

usb {
    greaseweazle {
        bus_type: SHUGART
    }
}
